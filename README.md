### Research Experience
* Software Engineering meets Intelligent Tutoring, ARISE LAB, UIC (Jan. 2015 – Present)
    - Knowledge transfer is an important and difficult problem in software engineering. In this research we outline how intelligent tutoring systems (ITSes) can assist stakeholders to solve knowledge transfer in software engineering projects and we suggest how different techniques and software artifacts can be used to generate ITSes.
